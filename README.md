# insect-identification
Insect identification from user images in the wild. Built with Python, PyTorch. Honours dissertation project.

## To-Do:
### March 2022
- [X] Finish Inference for Carabid model
    * [ ] Make Gradio demo
- [ ] Train other types of models over Leeds, Carabids, IP102 datasets
- [ ] Train model on iNaturalist Insecta subset using torchvision
    * [X] Train model on mini version of the Insecta subset (50 images per species)
- [ ] Prepare slides for project presentation session
- [ ] Finish dissertation report draft for review in early April

### February 2022
- [X] Implement better ways to evaluate model performance on test sets
    * [X] Table showing average per-class F1 and acc.
    * [X] [Confusion matrix with Seaborn](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35572000/how-can-i-plot-a-confusion-matrix)
- [X] [Training with IP102](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1uCMSaN3Xq_CiHeduMSPDhU1hi-STMkER?usp=sharing) -> [Results on W&B](https://wandb.ai/mawady-stirling/insect_IP102) -> 55% accuracy over test set
    * [ ] Hyperparameter tuning
    * [X] dataset split using `os.symlink()` on Colab
    * [X] dataset split using `os.symlink()` locally. Available at [link](https://github.com/ttheland/insect-identification/blob/main/code/symlink.ipynb)
- [X] Include model type in WandB logging
- [X] Make the repository public
    * Colab notebooks set to anyone with the link can view only
- [X] Implemented better accuracy logging and visualisation on the carabid model
    * [X] Known issue with not all metrics being logged 
- [X] Begin working on report

### January 2022
- [X] Make to do list through GitHub
- [X] Arrange meeting for interim demo (21.1.2022 10am)
- [X] Dataset download from Drive (zipfile)
- [X] Include Wandb.ai in model training. [Instructions](https://wandb.ai/quickstart/pytorch)
    * [X] Ensure hyperparameters are logged for the Carabid training
- [X] Data split and organisation programmatically
- [X] Train model on complete British Carabid set
    * [X] Improve model performance with data augmentation (random rotations)
- [X] Finish poster for session in February

## Notes from supervisor:
- Do anlysis using different lightweight classification models (e.g. resnet18, shufflenet, squeezenet, mobilenetv3), with option of quantization.
- Try one-class detection models (e.g. YoloV3, YoloV4, YoloV5, SSD, Retinanet) before classification for accurate recognition results.
- For experimentation, use Wandb.
- For demo, use huggingface with Gradio.
