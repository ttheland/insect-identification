## Interim Demo
- [ResNet training over Leeds butterfly dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JqHID3-KIvsfbumllTjkLdK874SsaJNE?usp=sharing) --> Seems to be working as expected!
- [ResNet training over Leeds butterfly dataset V2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oSc3CjQWnoguIFReSTg5YSlTJ0R0v5LG?usp=sharing)
  - Add progress bar
  - Add metrics to handle imbalance dataset
  - Automatically download trained data after training
