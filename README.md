# insect-identification
Honours dissertation project.

To-Do:
[X] Make to do list through GitHub
[ ] Include Wandb.ai in model training
[ ] Data split and organisation using sklearn
[ ] Dataset download from Drive (zipfile)
[ ] Train model on iNaturalist Insecta subset using torchvision
[ ] Improve current models' performance with data augmentation (random rotations)
[ ] Train model on IP102 dataset

## Interim Demo
- [ResNet training over Leeds butterfly dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JqHID3-KIvsfbumllTjkLdK874SsaJNE?usp=sharing) --> Seems to be working as expected!
- [ResNet training over Leeds butterfly dataset V2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oSc3CjQWnoguIFReSTg5YSlTJ0R0v5LG?usp=sharing)
  - Add progress bar
  - Add metrics to handle imbalance dataset
  - Automatically download trained data after training
- [ResNet inference over Leeds butterfly dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c8VLUCzBIN1YQsZRbxZehzIvayy_TLSO?usp=sharing)
- [ResNet training with the British Carabid Collection (7 classes version)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16oIcx00ae0xaplaCDcvFyCOrd8zcLKLM?usp=sharing) --> Training completed 03/01/22
- [Inference over Carabid dataset](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lhOWyEJ9Y9N2nN4qeGGJ5_ISNnAHv8Bm?usp=sharing) --> Works great on the training set. So-so performance on images from the wild.
